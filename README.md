# Hanna for Developers

Here are all the main developer resources (libraries/tools/documentation) for
Hanna design system, together in one happy monorepo.

## Setup / Contribute

First off, install the [`yarn` package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/), and
then run:

```sh
yarn install
```

This sets up all the neccessary githooks, configures git, and displays
notification explaining the git submodules containing the various server
setups/assets. (I.e. [style-server](https://styles.reykjavik.is) and
[HTML storybook](https://storybook.reykjavik.is)).

The repo is configured to use git LFS (Large File Storage). Make sure to
[download and install `git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com/) before you start
working.
